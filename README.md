## Background

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the White House and a coalition of leading research groups have prepared a dataset of open sourced research papers. This data-set is a resource of over 45,000 scholarly articles, including over 33,000 with full text, about COVID-19, SARSCoV-2, and related coronaviruses. This freely available dataset is provided to the global research community to apply recent advances in natural language processing and other AI techniques to generate new insights in support of the ongoing fight against this infectious disease. There is a growing urgency for these approaches because of the rapid acceleration in new coronavirus literature, making it difficult for the medical research community to keep up and extract insight from this growing body work.

## Project Objectives

1. Implement functionality to parse natural language biomedical literature data according to given constraints and requirements.
2. Train and test machine learning algorithms (especially unsupervised machine learning algorithms such as clustering, dimensionality reduction, recommender systems, association rules, etc.) in order to gain insights or answer the overarching question you have chosen to pursue for this project.
3. Understand how to apply machine learning algorithms to the task of learning from a large corpus of biomedical research text.
4. Improve on skills and competencies required to collate and present domain specific, evidence-based insights. Particularly, in this case to gain insights and guide the fight
against the COVID-19 pandemic
